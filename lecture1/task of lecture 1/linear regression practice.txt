# LINEAR REGRESSION â€“ PRACTICE

## PART 1

### 1. READ THE DATA
- Load the data from the CSV file **LifeExpectance** into a pandas DataFrame.

### 2. PREPARE THE DATA
- Split records into **train dataset** and **test dataset**.
- You can use:
  - `train_test_split` from `sklearn`
  - Your own function
  - Manually select records from the years **2003, 2008, and 2013** as the test set.
- Show basic information:
  - (a) Number of records in each dataset.
  - (b) Histogram of life expectancy & statistical info (mean, std, etc.).
  - (c) Identify **three countries with the highest life expectancy**.

### 3. TRAIN SIMPLE REGRESSION MODELS
- Train three **simple regression models** using:
  - (a) **GDP**
  - (b) **Total expenditure**
  - (c) **Alcohol consumption**

### 4. ANALYZE REGRESSION MODELS
- Find **coefficients** (slope, intercept) and **scores** for each model.
- Show **charts** with:
  - Data points from the training set
  - Regression lines
  - Equation of the regression line on each chart

### 5. MAKE PREDICTIONS & ANALYZE ERRORS
- Use trained models (Step 3) to **predict life expectancy** for the **test set**.
- Compute:
  - **Average error** for all models
  - **Standard deviation** of predictions

### 6. SUMMARIZE RESULTS
- Prepare a **report** summarizing:
  - Findings from the data and charts
  - **Conclusions** based on the analysis

## PART 2

### 1. SELECT OPTIMAL PARAMETERS
- Choose **four best parameters** for predicting life expectancy.
- Justify your selection in the final report.

### 2. TRAIN A MULTILINEAR REGRESSION MODEL
- Train a **multilinear regression model** using the **four selected parameters**.

### 3. EVALUATE THE MODEL
- Print:
  - **Coefficients** and **score** of the model
  - **Predictions** for the test set
  - **Statistical analysis of errors** (average, std, etc.)

### 4. COMPARE RESULTS
- Compare results with **Part 1, Step 5**.
- Write **conclusions** on:
  - Performance of the **multilinear regression model** vs. simple regression models.

## SUBMISSION
- Ensure **code is well-documented and structured**.
- Include a **summary** of findings in the final report.
- Indicate **which tasks were completed** in the submission.
